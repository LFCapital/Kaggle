15.071x - The Analytics Edge (Summer 2015)
===
This is my simple solution of the [competition](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/15-071x-the-analytics-edge-summer-2015/) for the MOOC, and the final grade is 113/1884.

`Feature_Construct.R` shows how to get features from the raw data, and `xgboost.R` demonstrates the nice performance of the library [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost).
